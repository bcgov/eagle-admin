## Pre-requisites

Note: The following commands work in MacOS bash (not zsh which now default in Catalina). The scripts are currently not fully working in Windows and Linux, so you may need to look at the source of the scripts and manually apply the commands in a right order.

Run the following two scripts to create your environment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
.\install_prerequisites.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
.\setup_project.sh
```

## Fork, Build and Run

1. After installing Node and Yarn, you can fork or straight download a copy of this application to start your own app.
1. Run `npm start` to start the webpack server to run the application on port 4200.

    Go to <http://localhost:4200> to verify that the application is running.

    :bulb: To change the default port, open `.angular-cli.json`, change the value on `defaults.serve.port`.

1. Run `npm run build` to just build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build, like so: `ng serve --prod` to run in production mode.
1. Run `npm run lint` to just lint your app code using TSLint.
